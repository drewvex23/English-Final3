                <p class="intro-txt"> &nbsp &nbsp My American Dream I believe is fairly simple. After graduating from high school I plan on going to college somewhere in New England for either an engineering or computer science degree. During my time in college I plan on getting a steady part time job to assist in any student loans I may have. When in college I also hope to be playing basketball, hopefully on a full scholarship, if I can’t, then I hope to be a walk on. After graduating college with hopefully no debt, I hope to get hired by a tech company or work IT for a big company. When I acquire enough money, I will buy a nice two story house on a lake with a big backyard for my dog and eventually kids to play in. I plan to get married when I’m around thirty years old to someone I’ve been with for at least five years, so I’m not impulsively making a life altering decision at a young age. Once I am married my spouse and I will make the decision to have kids or not and if we do I would like to have two kids, a boy and a girl. I hope to retire early with a perfect amount of money to live freely with. I want to get a really nice old or sports car and have two family cars. </p>
                <p class="intro-txt"> &nbsp &nbsp I believe that I would be successful in reaching my dream because of my determination and hard work. I will work hard to finish high school with high honors to help find a good college for engineering or computer science. I will work as hard as I can to do as well as I can in basketball so I can hopefully get a scholarship for that as well. When reaching college I will then work even harder to get my degree, graduate and then get a full time job.</p>
                <p class="intro-txt"> &nbsp &nbsp Pursuing and achieving my American Dream will make me happy since it fulfills my personal belief. My personal belief is that anyone can achieve their dream through hard work and dedication. Another belief I have is along the lines of my first belief and it’s that all dreams are worth fighting for no matter what the dream might be. Since I have these beliefs I believe that is why I am very likely to achieve my American Dream.</p>
